                <h2>I've struggled with my weight my entire life.</h2>
                <p>I had periods of being thinner, and periods of not caring. Life was not only a yo-yo, it was a life of extremes. I was either eating in a super strict manner (and feeling miserable and like I was punishing myself) or I just said, “screw it' and ate whatever I wanted, indulging in whatever I felt like eating, WHENEVER I felt like eating it.</p>
                <p>Throw cancer into the mix and it was very hard to want to “diet” when you're in pain, just trying to get through the day, limited in what you can physically do, or just plain scared.</p>
                <h3>Food is definitely my love language. I love cooking and baking, and the truth is, that's how I show you I love YOU too! Food is the ultimate form of comfort, love, coping, fun, community... it was the center of my universe.</h3>

                <p>You see, I owned a farm, where I raised grass fed beef, pork, chicken, lamb, and veal. Further, I turned that into 2 food trucks, a catering business and a bakery.</p>
                <h3>Sounds great, right?</h3>
                <p>Well... I'd be lying if I didn't say that I loved every minute of it. It was a lot of work, but it was incredibly satisfying, and I loved it!</p>
                <h3>So, what was the problem?</h3>
                <p>For starters, my husband was in Afghanistan for 14 years working on a project and was never home. I survived by not sleeping and shoving easy food in my mouth that required little to no prep, and more importantly NO CLEAN UP. (Who had time for THAT?)</p>
                <h3>You know what dinners became?</h3>
                <p>Chips, Pop Tarts, Cereal, Pizza Rolls (tip: if you put parchment down before you bake them you don’t have to clean the pan – you're welcome!)</p>

                <h3>Fat. In fact, HUGE! And Type II Diabetes for good measure.</h3>
                <p>I went on plan in May 2020—6 months before my 50th birthday—weighing the most I had ever weighed in my life – <b>287.2 pounds.</b> I survived cancer and farming and 14 years without my husband and the one thing that I loved the most had betrayed me. I felt awful, had problems with my feet and legs, my stomach was horrifyingly huge, and I couldn’t find clothes to fit. I felt like getting a t-shirt that read <b>“I struggle just to get through the day – and all I got was lousy Diabetes”.</b></p>

            <p>So, this website is a labor of love for me. I plan to let you into my world both before and now. <br> I hope that something... ANYTHING on this site resonates with you, regardless of where you are in your journey – just starting, in the middle, or done and enjoying your newfound health.</p>
